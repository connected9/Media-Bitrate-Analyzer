A user-friendly desktop GUI for generating detailed bitrate analysis charts for any video or audio file.

</div>


This tool leverages the power of FFmpeg/ffprobe to provide a deep insight into the encoding quality of your media files. It's designed for media professionals, developers, and enthusiasts who need a quick, reliable way to visualize variable bitrate data.

‚ú® Key Features

üñ•Ô∏è Intuitive GUI: A clean and simple interface built with native Python libraries.

üñ±Ô∏è Drag & Drop: Easily add files by dragging them onto the window.

üìÇ Batch Processing: Analyze multiple files at once with a clear progress display.

üìà Detailed Bitrate Charts: Generates a high-quality .png chart for each file, visualizing bitrate over time.

üìù Comprehensive Metadata: Charts include a dedicated header with crucial info:

File Duration, Size, and Overall Bitrate

Video Codec, Resolution, and Average Bitrate

Audio Codec, Sample Rate, Channel Layout, and Average Bitrate

‚ö° Responsive & Non-Blocking: The multi-threaded architecture ensures the app never freezes, even with large files.

üåê Universal File Support: Intelligently analyzes any format supported by your FFmpeg installation (.mp4, .mkv, .flac, etc.).

üí™ Robust Error Handling: If a file fails, the app reports the error and seamlessly continues with the next file in the batch.

‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured on your system.

Python 3.7+ and the pip package manager.

FFmpeg: This is the core engine for the analysis.

‚ùóÔ∏è CRUCIAL: ffmpeg and ffprobe must be accessible from your system's command line (i.e., they are in the system's PATH).

Verify your installation by opening a terminal and running ffprobe -version. If it prints version information, you're all set!

üöÄ Installation & Usage

Follow these simple steps to get the analyzer running.

Get the Code

Download the video_analyzer_app_v4.py script to a new folder on your computer.

Install Python Libraries

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required packages:

Generated bash
pip install matplotlib tkinterdnd2


Launch the Application

In your terminal, navigate to the folder where you saved the script and run:

Generated bash
python video_analyzer_app_v4.py

Analyze Your Files

Add files using Drag & Drop or the "Browse Files" button.

Select the files you wish to process in the list (Ctrl+Click, Shift+Click, or "Select All").

Click "Analyze Selected".

View Your Results

A .png chart for each successfully processed file will be saved in the same folder as the script.

üìä The Output Chart

The generated chart is designed for clarity and provides a complete data snapshot.

The chart includes:

Main Title: The full filename, wrapped intelligently to fit.

Details Header: A clean, boxed-off section with key metadata.

Plot Area: A graph of bitrate (kbps) vs. time (seconds).

üîß How It Works: The Architecture

The application is built on a robust three-part architecture to ensure stability and responsiveness.

View (GUI): Handles all user interactions without performing any heavy work itself.

Controller (Worker Thread): Manages the analysis queue, processing one file at a time off the main thread to prevent the UI from freezing.

Model (Engine): Contains the core logic, executing ffprobe commands and using matplotlib to generate the output images.

‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

Encountered an issue? Here are solutions to common problems.

<details>
<summary><strong>Error: "ffprobe not found" or "Dependency Missing"</strong></summary>


Problem: The script cannot find the ffprobe executable.

Solution: You must add the directory containing ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe to your system's PATH environment variable.

Windows: Search for "Edit the system environment variables", click "Environment Variables...", select the "Path" variable under "System variables", click "Edit...", "New", and paste the path to your FFmpeg bin folder (e.g., C:\ffmpeg\bin). Restart your terminal.

macOS/Linux: Edit your shell profile file (e.g., ~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile) and add the line: export PATH="/path/to/your/ffmpeg/bin:$PATH". Save the file and restart your terminal or run source ~/.zshrc.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Error: "Permission denied" when saving the chart</strong></summary>


Problem: The script does not have permission to write files in its current location.

Solution: Make sure you are running the script from a directory where you have write permissions (e.g., your Desktop or Documents folder). Avoid running it from protected locations like C:\Program Files.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Analysis is very slow the first time, then fast.</strong></summary>


Observation: The first file takes a long time, but analyzing it again is almost instant.

Explanation: This is normal and is due to File System Caching. The first time, your computer reads the file from the slow disk. Your operating system then keeps a copy in fast RAM. Subsequent analyses read from RAM, which is much faster. This is not a bug, but a feature of modern operating systems.
